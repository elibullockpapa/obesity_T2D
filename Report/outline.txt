1. Abstract
- Summarize the goal of the report, methods, and findings.
- Highlight the importance of modeling obesity treatments with GLP-1 agonists and replicating real-world outcomes.

2. Introduction and Motivation
- Why Modeling Obesity Matters
  - The rise of obesity and its connection to Type II Diabetes (T2D).
  - Importance of identifying treatment windows for GLP-1 agonists like Wegovy to maximize efficacy.
- Why GLP-1 Agonists are Revolutionary
  - Overview of Semaglutide's multiple effects (weight loss and blood glucose control).

3. Past and Current Understanding of Obesity and T2D
- Historical Perspective
  - Insulin resistance theories and beta-cell dysfunction.
- Modern Understanding
  - Pathways involving insulin, glucose, Free Fatty Acids (FFA), and inflammation leading to T2D.
  - Include labeled pathway diagrams with brief explanations.

4. 4-Year Weight Loss Data Adjustments and Calorie Reductions
- Data Source: SELECT Trial
  - Summarize findings from the SELECT trial on Semaglutide for weight loss across BMI categories.
- Adjusting the Trial Data
  - Extracting the 4-year weight loss data.
  - Adjusting for perfect adherence to drug and placebo arms to isolate treatment effects.
  - BMI Class Breakdown
    - Explain how you adjusted weight loss data for BMI classes (e.g., <30, 30-35, 35-40, ≥40 kg/m²).
- Calorie Reduction Estimations
  - Real-world trials report weight loss, not calorie intake reductions.
  - Describe how calorie reductions were estimated to replicate observed weight loss findings.
  - Include BMI to weight to calories needed calculations:
BMI Category | Initial Weight | Initial Calories | Final Weight | Final Calories | Weight Change
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    <30     |      90.7      |      2805       |     81.2     |      2506      |    -10.5    %
   30-35    |     105.3      |      3258       |     92.9     |      2871      |    -11.8    %
   35-40    |     121.5      |      3763       |    106.9     |      3311      |    -12.0    %
    ≥40     |     136.1      |      4216       |    119.4     |      3697      |    -12.2    %


5. Mimicking Wegovy Treatment Course
- Creating the Ramp-Up Function
  - Simulating gradual ramp-up of Wegovy treatment:
    - Treatment start time.
    - Ramp duration.
    - Minimum calorie intake thresholds.
- Aligning the Simulation Model
  - Discuss adjustments to starting parameters in your model to match the trial weight outcomes.

6. Model Results: Simulating Treatments
- Baseline and Extended Simulations
  - Results when treatment starts at year 5 with a 30% calorie drop.
- Key Outcomes
  - Compare model outputs for variables like insulin, glucose, beta-cell mass, etc.
- Insights and Gaps
  - Discuss alignment and mismatches with real-world trials.

7. Important Caveats
- Model Limitations
  - Explain Wegovy’s non-weight loss effects on blood sugar control.
  - Highlight anecdotal evidence of rapid blood sugar improvements in severe diabetes cases (200 mg/dL+), which are implausible under the current model.

8. Conclusions and Future Work
- Key Takeaways
  - The model aligns directionally with trial data, demonstrating GLP-1 agonist effects on weight, insulin sensitivity, and inflammation.
- Future Directions
  - More accurate modeling is needed to capture non-weight mechanisms and replicate medical trial results.

9. References
- Include all sources, such as SELECT trial data, prior models, and relevant literature.
