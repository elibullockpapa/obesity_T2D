Abstract
- Summarize the goal of the report, methods, and findings.
- Highlight the importance of modeling obesity treatments with GLP-1 agonists and replicating real-world outcomes.
- The goal is to model treatment windows and validate this diabetes and weight loss model with real-world data to test its clinical relevance.

1. Introduction and Motivation
- Why Modeling Obesity Matters
  - The rise of obesity as a global health crisis:
    * Adult obesity rates in the US increased from 30.5% (1999-2000) to 41.9% (2017-2020)
    * Severe obesity doubled from 4.7% to 9.2% in the same period
    * Over 100 million US adults have obesity, with 22 million having severe obesity
    * Childhood obesity affects 20% of US children and adolescents
  - The connection between obesity and Type II Diabetes (T2D)
  - Importance of identifying treatment windows for GLP-1 agonists like Wegovy to maximize efficacy
- Why GLP-1 Agonists are Revolutionary
  - Overview of Semaglutide's multiple effects (weight loss and blood glucose control).

2. Background: Past and Current Understanding of Obesity and T2D
- Historical Perspective
  - Insulin resistance theories and beta-cell dysfunction.
- Modern Understanding
  - Early-Life Positive Energy Balance: Excessive caloric intake relative to energy expenditure leads to increased fat storage and obesity from a young age
  - Adipose Tissue Expansion and Metabolic Signals: Growing fat mass secretes inflammatory molecules and free fatty acids that impair insulin response
  - Insulin Resistance and Compensation: Pancreatic β-cells increase insulin production to maintain glucose levels, causing chronic hyperinsulinemia
  - β-Cell Stress and Dysfunction: Sustained high insulin demand strains β-cells, reducing efficiency and causing cell death
  - Progression to Youth-Onset Type 2 Diabetes: Declining β-cell function combined with insulin resistance leads to elevated blood glucose and early T2D onset
- Include labeled pathway diagrams with brief explanations. The diagram is in images/obesity_and_t2d_diagram.png and has numbered paths labeled 1-16

3. Setting up the simulation
- Data Source: SELECT Trial
  - Summarize findings from the SELECT trial on Semaglutide for weight loss across BMI categories.
- Adjusting the Trial Data
  - Extracting the 4-year weight loss data.
  - Adjusting for perfect adherence to drug and placebo arms to isolate treatment effects.
  - BMI Class Breakdown
    - Explain how you adjusted weight loss data for BMI classes (e.g., <30, 30-35, 35-40, ≥40 kg/m²).
- Calorie Reduction Estimations
  - Real-world trials report weight loss, not calorie intake reductions.
  - Describe how calorie reductions were estimated to replicate observed weight loss findings.
  - Include BMI to weight to calories needed calculations:
BMI Category | Initial Weight | Initial Calories | Final Weight | Final Calories | Weight Change
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    <30     |      90.7      |      2805       |     81.2     |      2506      |    -10.5    %
   30-35    |     105.3      |      3258       |     92.9     |      2871      |    -11.8    %
   35-40    |     121.5      |      3763       |    106.9     |      3311      |    -12.0    %
    ≥40     |     136.1      |      4216       |    119.4     |      3697      |    -12.2    %
- Creating the Ramp-Up Function
  - Simulating gradual ramp-up of Wegovy treatment:
    - Treatment start time. (5 years)
    - Ramp duration. (2 months)
    - Minimum calorie intake thresholds.

4. Model Results and caveats
- Baseline and Extended Simulations
  - Results when treatment starts at year 5 with a 30% calorie drop.
- Key Outcomes
  - Compare model outputs for variables like insulin, glucose, beta-cell mass, etc.
- Insights and Gaps
  - Discuss alignment and mismatches with real-world trials.
- Model Limitations
  - Explain Wegovy’s non-weight loss effects on blood sugar control.
  - Highlight anecdotal evidence of rapid blood sugar improvements in severe diabetes cases (200 mg/dL+), which are implausible under the current model.

5. Conclusions and Future Work
- Key Takeaways
  - The model aligns directionally with trial data, demonstrating GLP-1 agonist effects on weight, insulin sensitivity, and inflammation.
- Future Directions
  - More accurate modeling is needed to capture non-weight mechanisms and replicate medical trial results.
